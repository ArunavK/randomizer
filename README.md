# randomizer

Implementation of pseudo-random shuffling of lists in multiple programming languages.

## Details
Mainly for personal use and knowledge. Not secure enough for use in cryptography. Good enough for lotteries.<br>
Using Mercenne Twister algorithm (default in all languages) to implement the PRNG.<br>
Hardware-based randomness or at least OS-based randomness is being used for seeding wherever possible (although it IS overkill for my purposes).<br>

## Current Implementations
<ul>
    <li>C++</li>
    <li>Python</li>
</ul>
